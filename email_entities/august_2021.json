Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin should RESIGN immediately following the complete collapse of Afghanistan at the hands of the Taliban. We haven't seen images like the ones from the front lines since the fall of Saigon. This is NOT a display of American Exceptionalism, and it's NOT the way we treat our men and women in uniform and the American citizens on the ground! Everyone responsible for this botched withdrawal should resign immediately! If you believe Joe Biden failed our Armed Forces and our American interests on the ground in Afghanistan, stand with me by making your immediate contribution of $25, $50, $100, $250, or even $1,000 today. Joe Biden's failure in Afghanistan destabilizes the Middle East and jeopardizes our security and the safety of our allies in Israel. Since July: Joe Biden has assured the American people Kabul WOULD NOT fall to the Taliban. He has given the Taliban a list of Americans and other high-profile allies, putting them in danger of being captured and tortured\u2026 or worse. He presided over a suicide bombing near an entrance to the airport in Kabul, leading to the deaths of more than a dozen U.S. military personnel and dozens of others. He and Secretary Blinken have begun importing unvetted immigrants from Afghanistan, including those with potential ties to extremist groups! President Trump issued a timeline for withdrawal, but he would never have left American forces and diplomats on the ground without resources to defend our interests and get out safely. Joe Biden surrendered in Afghanistan, and he surrendered the America First policies that make our nation great. Joe Biden is failing to lead our country, and it's absolutely shameful. It's time to hold Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Lloyd Austin accountable - they should resign immediately! I'm forcing their hand in Congress, and I'm asking for your immediate help. If you want to save America's greatness in the face of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, please chip in $1,000, $250, $100, $50, or even $25 right away. Joe Biden's failure in Afghanistan will echo across the globe, weaken our position as a global leader, and embolden terrorists. You and I must hold him accountable. Thank you.

Can you donate right now \u2013 before our critical end-of-month deadline at midnight \u2013 to help elect Marco Lopez (D), defeat these extremists and flip Arizona blue? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/marco-lopez-for-governor_email3?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk188-fr-text We're FINALLY in a position to kick these extremists out of power \u2013 but there's a major problem: The Arizona GOP is bringing its most dangerous conspiracy theorists to our state to attack our democracy. First, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz \u2013 the Trump-obsessed, QAnon-backing, \"Stop the Steal\" duo \u2013 came to challenge President Biden's victory. Then Donald Trump himself came to rile up his rabid base and keep battleground Arizona red! Arizona Republicans should be ashamed of these conspiracy theorists. But instead, Doug Ducey, Kelli Ward and our GOP opponents are 100% focused on propping them up instead of solving the problems facing working Arizonans. That's why Marco Lopez (D) \u2013 a former border-city mayor and Obama administration alum \u2013 is running for governor to defeat these Republican extremists and flip Arizona blue. Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight confirms that this race is a TOSS-UP, which means Democrats need a fighter here who can win. But POLITICO is reporting that Republicans are getting ready to spend BIG to defeat us \u2013 and right now, we're falling short of the resources we need to fight back and win this race. In a fight against this much far-right firepower, every dollar counts. So please \u2013 with only HOURS until our critical end-of-month fundraising deadline \u2013 will you donate whatever you can spare to flip Arizona blue and defeat these dangerous GOP extremists? https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/marco-lopez-for-governor_email3?amounts=5,25,50,100,250&refcode;=jtk188-fr-text Thank you, Team Lopez -------- This email was sent to dpwillis67@gmail.com.

We are America First patriots supporting Trump and actuallyFIGHTING Biden - pressuring Congressmen and Senators to remove him fromoffice! At this point, is there any real doubt that His Fraudulency has been acomplete disaster? A wave of prominent Republican lawmakers on Thursday calledfor President Joe Biden to be impeached or to resign, arguing his decisionscreated an environment ripe for crisis that indicates he is not capable ofleadership. \u201cJoe Biden, Kamala Harris, Antony Blinken, Lloyd Austin andGeneral Milley should all resign or face impeachment and removal from office,\u201dTennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn tweeted. \u201cThis is the product of Joe Biden\u2019scatastrophic failure of leadership. It is now painfully clear he has neitherthe will nor the capacity to lead. He must resign,\u201d Missouri Sen. Josh Hawleysaid in a statement. They join a chorus of other Republicans calling forBiden\u2019s resignation, impeachment, or removal by the 25th Amendment, as well asthe resignation of other top officials in his administration, as Talibanforces took control of the country amid a chaotic U.S. exit. Will you help uspressure lawmakers to #FIREBIDEN? (https://secure.anedot.com/draintheswamp/st)https://secure.anedot.com/draintheswamp/st Unfortunately, that's not all thisincompetent President has unleashed on us. Gas prices are at an 8 year highand spiking, thanks for Biden's anti-energy \"Green New Deal\" policies. It'spart of a general spike in prices- known as inflation, which is defined as toomany dollars chasing too few goods. In other words, the Federal Government isprinting money like crazy but the country isn't producing enough. Welcome toSocialism. And of course, we have all seen the grizzly images of thehumanitarian crisis at the Southern border. Tens of thousands of unaccompaniedchildren, criminals and gang members, and illegal immigrants streaming acrossour border. Not only has Biden refused to enforce Federal law, but he actuallySTOPPED construction on Trump's border wall, which was actually working tostop illegal immigration! He has refused to enforce Federal immigration law,for which the Supreme Court has already smacked him down. He is spending usinto oblivion and causing inflation, paying people NOT to work. It's time toend this nightmare. Time to use impeachment, or the 25th Amendment, to#FIREBIDEN. https://secure.anedot.com/draintheswamp/st Now, this won't beeasy. There are some weak-kneed \"Republicans\" who will resist. That's whyDrain the DC Swamp PAC needs to pressure those weak Republicans and soft Demsto impeach him and remove him! Who knows, maybe if he's impeached he mightresign like Nixon did. God knows he should. We cannot trust the politicians todo the right thing- many of them, anyway. They won't see the light until theyfeel the heat! It's time to block ALL of Biden's nominees to anything. It'stime to block ALL his legislation. It's time to remove this demented foolbefore he destroys the country. The 14 American soldiers killed in Afghanistandue to Biden's incompetence and lies deserve nothing less.

In my campaign, I am fighting for the people of Wisconsin -- not the special interests. This isn\u2019t politics as usual, my campaign is about bringing fresh ideas to Congress so that we can help Wisconsinites. For too long, we\u2019ve been represented by a Senator by the name of Ron Johnson who refuses to do anything to help everyday Wisconsinites. His inaction and obsession with blocking any progress from happening in this country have hurt Wisconsin workers, and it\u2019s time to stand up and fight back. We have the power to defeat Ron Johnson, and I\u2019m running a competitive campaign that can and will win next November. But I need your help today before midnight tonight to help close the $2,994 gap in our monthly fundraising budget. I wouldn\u2019t be asking if it weren\u2019t crucial to our campaign\u2019s success, so can I count on you to chip in before midnight tonight?

The endorsement reads: I am honored toendorse Loren Culp in Washington's 4th Congressional District. Loren Culp isan icon in Washington politics. After exploding onto the political scene in2018 by refusing to comply with Olympia's unconstitutional gun ban, hishistoric Gubernatorial run last year sparked a wave of conservative grassrootsactivism across the State of Washington and garnered more votes than anyRepublican Gubernatorial candidate in Washington State history. Mr. Culp'sopponent is an America Last RINO that voted to impeach President Trump, sidedwith Nancy Pelosi to form the January 6th Commission--a move that would targetAmerica First Patriots as extremists, authored a bill to facilitate amnesty,and currently has one of the lowest conservative ratings in Congress. Ibelieve together we can remove the America Last RINOs from Washingtonpolitics, save our Republic, and restore our nation's future.

They just go on and on (andon) about how Donald Trump won this state.  **You know what I think? NEVER bet against Ohio.**  There\u2019s no secret sauce to winning tough elections beyond hard work andstaying focused on what matters most to the people you hope to serve. Nomatter where you live, everyone wants their representatives to fight forliving wages, affordable health care, and good-paying jobs in our communities.  But Mitch McConnell and his big-money donors have no interest in that. For toolong, they\u2019ve run rampant in Washington, allowing special interests to pullthe strings behind closed-door meetings.  **Well, I am sick and tired of special interests calling the shots whileeveryday folks get ignored. And if you\u2019re with me, I need your help to flipOhio\u2019s Senate seat blue.**  **National Republicans will spend MILLIONS to buy this race and retake the Senate majority.

I am the voice of the grassroots movementsweeping America in every state \u2013 Election Integrity. >From the start, Ifought for election integrity paying for critical hearings out of pocket, Ihave fought to put America\u2019s Audit on the map, and I have fought to keep itsafe from personal, political, and legal attacks going all the way up toMerrick Garland and the Department of Justice. And now I am running forSecretary of State of Arizona. And one by one, they have been defeated andAmerica\u2019s Audit has prevailed, one foot in front of the other. And this couldnot happen without you and me working together. This is why once again I mustask for your help. Right now, we are busy fighting the latest challenge,something fairly innocuously called: NASS Task Force on Vote Verification:Post-election Audit Recommendations. Before I dive into this particularlynasty piece of propaganda, I need you to understand something. We are upagainst a critical deadline by September first. While we have raised atremendous amount of support over the last few days, we are still $8,400 shyof reaching our fundraising goal. We are THIS close.(https://secure.anedot.com/mark-finchem-for-secretary-of-state/st)https://secure.anedot.com/mark-finchem-for-secretary-of-state/st We need toraise this money to mobilize support, promote America\u2019s Audit and resultswhile we are being silenced by mainstream media, and to make sure our campaignhas the infrastructure to weather the attacks that WILL come from all sides \u2013everyone who opposes the sanctity of American Election Integrity! And this iswhy I must again ask for your help. Please make a contribution today to ensurethat the Election Integrity movement stays strong!(https://secure.anedot.com/mark-finchem-for-secretary-of-state/st) First, letme make clear exactly what the responsibilities of Secretary of State are.Here are a few: * Act as \u201cChief Election Officer\u201d * Certify statewide electionresults * Record campaign finances of candidates You might notice that theposition is centered around keeping elections free and fair. Well, as future\u201cChief Election Officer\u201d of Arizona, let me tell you what the Secretary ofStates are trying to do, in almost unison, to squash election integrity. Theexplicit goal of the NASS Task Force on Vote Verification was to ensure thatnothing like \u201ca Maricopa-Style Forensic Audit would ever happen again.\u201d Why? Iwill continue to challenge this: Why is a third-party independent auditoverseen by the legislative such a bad thing? This is an explicit duty of thelegislative. Nonetheless, one thing is clear. It is the job of the Secretaryof State to protect elections, not prevent them from falling under thescrutiny of the people. This is America. This is a Democracy. This is not thetyranny of a cabal of partisan Secretary of States too scared to have thepeople take a second look at how shoddily they are running their elections!Preventing Maricopa-style audits does one thing really well: it obscures thefact that there are several really good measures to reduce the need for auditsto begin with: * Defect elimination * Multi-factor authentication * Ballotfraud countermeasures. Instead, the executive Secretaries of State decidedthat it was their prerogative to override the duty of the Legislative and theright of the People to oversee the elections. This joint statement reads: TheNASS Task Force on Vote Verification encourages states to consider thefollowing recommendations for all types of post-election audits: \u25cf Statesshould have a requirement and timeframe, ideally in state statute, for post-election audits in place prior to an election. These defined requirementsshould include conducting the audit as soon as reasonably possible after anelection, as well as a process to recertify election results based on theresults of the audit. \u25cf Ensuring chain of custody procedures throughout thepost-election audit process is paramount. Election officials should be able totrack the movement and transport of ballots, voting machines, and otherelection materials through witnesses, signature logs, security seals, video,etc. A break in the chain of custody increases the risk that the integrity orreliability of the asset cannot be restored. The EAC Chain of Custody BestPractices document and CISA Chain of Custody and Critical InfrastructureSystems document should be used as a reference when establishing theseprocedures. \u25cf Have state and/or local election officials be an integral partof the post-election audit process, including in the selection of theprecincts or equipment to be audited. The involvement of any third-partyentities, like a CPA firm, should be determined by the Chief State ElectionOfficial or state legislative act prior to an election, and those entitiesmust work closely with election officials. \u25cf The post-election audit methodsand processes must be transparent. This includes identifying who may observethe audit, which should include members of the public, media, political partyand/or candidate representatives. Once the results of the post-election auditare completed and certified, they should be made publicly accessibleconsistent with state law. \u25cf To avert the possibility of voting systemsbecoming unusable, states should have criteria in place prior to an electionfor the use of a federally or a state accredited test lab to perform any auditof voting machine hardware or software. \u25cf States should make every effort toeducate the public on their post-election audit process, as well as otherprocesses and procedures in place to ensure the accuracy and public trust ofthe results. In effect, what these recommendations do is force the People andthe Legislative to let the government try and hold itself accountable. Thismeans that in the event of fraud, the expectation of the people should be thatthe people who are trying to STEAL the election are the same ones who shouldhold themselves accountable. This is ridiculous. This is like the NationalAssociation of Bank Robbers coming together to claim that Bank Robbersshouldn\u2019t be arrested, they should hold each other accountable to not rob anymore banks. This is on its face absurd, and this is why I am running forSecretary of State of Arizona. The Secretaries of State agreed on this almostunanimously, which means that almost every Secretary of State in Americathinks it is the prerogative of the Secretary of State to take power from thepeople. I want to represent the people and give power back to the people,which is what I have been fighting for every single day! But nevertheless, weare under attack once again in Maricopa and the Left is trying to squash allpossibilities of a nationwide audit in every state. We need to get the wordout on the Audit, and fast.

Multiple opponents have already declared their candidacy to challenge Abigail in Virginia\u2019s 7th District. They know how competitive this seat is and will do everything in their power to defeat her. 2. Outside groups have already launched ad campaigns to discredit her work in Congress. As we get closer to the election, there will be more attacks. 3. House Democrats know that this seat is vulnerable \u2014 that\u2019s why they added Abigail to the Frontline list, which names House Democrats who must win in 2022. 4. Abigail is working every single day to serve the hard-working people of Central Virginia. She needs to win this race to continue advocating for the expansion of rural broadband, to lower prescription drug prices, and to keep fighting for the kitchen table issues that Central Virginians care about. Peter, the stakes of this race are high, but we have a team strong enough to weather any of the challenges that we face. I am confident that with your support, we can hold this seat in 2022. Can I count on you for a contribution before our August deadline?

So why are Nancy Pelosi and the Democratsgoverning like this is a socialist country? It all comes down to power andcontrol for the leftists. But as your Congressman, I\u2019ve co-sponsored over 70pieces of legislation in just half a year, bringing jobs and prosperitydirectly to the Long Island area\u2026 leaving the partisan games to Pelosi. Peter,I need your help to keep doing my work here. I want to continue standing upfor YOU in Congress\u2026 but right now, I\u2019m counting on your support. We\u2019re JUST$3,452 away from our goal\u2026 will you rush a $5, $25, or $50 donation to mycampaign today? Your backing in this fight is so crucial, Peter. The GOP mustretake the House in 2022\u2026 our American institutions depend on it.

Because they're coming after members likeme who stood up for President Trump and against the Democrat takeover of ourelections. Make no mistake: this is nothing more than an attempt to hide ChinaJoe's impeachable activity like the Afghanistan debacle. But I'm not backingdown. JOE BIDEN MUST BE IMPEACHED. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not next year.NOW! SIGN YOUR IMPEACH JOE BIDEN PETITION RIGHT AWAY After you sign, I'masking you to please consider going the extra mile by chipping in $100, $50,$25, $15 -- whatever you can most afford -- to help me \"Impeach Joe Biden\" andhelp me build momentum across America to IMPEACH JOE BIDEN. Joe Biden refusesto resign. Republicans must impeach him before China Joe can do any moredamage to America. SIGN YOUR IMPEACH JOE BIDEN PETITION RIGHT AWAY There is notime to delay. We must move swiftly to ensure that Joe Biden can no longerhurt our country and destroy it piece by piece. The case against Joe Biden inSTRONG. Consider President Biden's: Dereliction of duty in Afghanistan; andViolations of immigration law that has caused a national security crisis onour Southern border; In seven short months, Joe Biden has caused America tolose the respect of the entire world. The evidence is clear and his actionsare so egregious that he must be impeached. Joe Biden DISHONORED thesacrifices made by every American soldier who fought in the 20-year war,especially those who gave their life for the cause. Joe Biden LEFT BEHIND over10,000 American citizens to face the terrifying rule of the Taliban as theyimpose Sharia law across the country. No commander-in-chief should ever leaveAmericans behind! Joe Biden (along with Kamala Harris) VIOLATED ourimmigration laws, deprived our Border Patrol of manpower and resources, andcreated a national security crisis by allowing unknown foreign nationals intoour country who wish to do harm to Americans. That is why I am draftingArticles of Impeachment against President Joe Biden. Will you become a CitizenCoSponsor to urge your Representatives and Senators to get on board? TheTaliban have made a fool of Joe Biden. America's southern border is beingoverrun with hordes of illegal aliens. Our economy is crippled because of theChinese Covid bioweapon. The world is laughing at us and Joe Biden has fledinto hiding! China Joe must go. 75 million Americans are fed up with inaction.Will you join and become a citizen co-sponsor? I need you to join this fight:become a Citizen Co-Sponsor by signing your \"Impeach Joe Biden\" petition!After you sign, I'm asking you to please consider going the extra mile bychipping in $100, $50, $25, $15 -- whatever you can most afford -- to the\"Impeach Joe Biden Fund\" and help me build momentum across America to IMPEACHJOE BIDEN. The Biden Crime Family must be held accountable. So please, afteryou become a citizen co-sponsor to impeach Joe Biden, consider donating beforethe deadline.

Words aren\u2019t enough,which is why this week I filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court askingit to overturn Roe v. Wade. I talked with Laura Ingraham about the criticalneed to overturn Roe and Casey. If you believe that every person is fearfullyand wonderfully made, if you stand for life, and if you stand for futuregenerations, join me in fighting the evils of abortion!!
