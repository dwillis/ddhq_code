And to make matters worse, anti-choice Republicans across thecountry are just getting started. Republicans in Florida, Arkansas, Indiana,Mississippi, North Dakota, and South Dakota have already expressed interest inreplicating the Texas ban -- and even more are likely to follow.

        "body": "Peter, It's ridiculous, isn't it? But it's necessary. Why? Because corporate PACs, Super PACs, and other dark money groups spent an average of $3,000,000 opposing each of our veteran and military family candidates of integrity for Congress last November. Regular people of good character just can't compete with that on their own. That's why we need you. Taking the Hill funds the kinds of candidates you want in public office - those who have proven their integrity over years of service to our country. And we've got a simple goal for them that isn't based on money - it's powered by people. We'll break down the math for you: -We are endorsing 22 candidates for the US House and Senate in 2022, and we want to help them each reach at least 10,000 veteran and military family voters in their districts. In total, that's more than 200,000 voters. -Whether it's door-to-door, in their mailbox, or on TV, the average cost of voter contact across all mediums last cycle was ~$5 per voter. That means that, between now and next November, we need to raise more than $1 million to win - or roughly $75,000 per month. -We're coming to you because we need to raise another $8,000 today to hit that target - and keep our good, decent, and honorable candidates on the path to victory. If every person who reads this email chips in to help us reach 10 voters today (that's just $50!) by clicking here (https://secure.actblue.com/donate/tth093021), we will exceed our goal and be able to go up on the airwaves and help get volunteers to canvas for our candidates. That's huge! As a BONUS, anyone who helps us reach more than 200 voters (by contributing $1,000 or more) will get FREE admission to the rest of our political events this year. Previous guests have included Cory Booker, Tammy Duckworth, and Raphael Warnock - you don't want to miss them! Thank you for opening this email and understanding why we write to you! We hope we're making you proud.

For us, it is a critical date BECAUSE after midnightTONIGHT, we'll have to make public what we have been able to raise for ourSenate campaign since announcing just four weeks ago. Peter, would you pleasespare 16 seconds of your time and watch the video I recorded for you? Then, ifyou're able to make a gift to our campaign, please consider doing so. Comenext week, the entire country will know the strength of our campaign - and Iwant everyone to know we are strong enough to win. I need your support to hitall of our goals while there is still time left. Here are three reasons whyour Q3 numbers are important: My opponent already has $10 million in his warchest, and National Democrats just announced they are spending millions ofdollars to launch the earliest ground game ever seen in Georgia. We needimmediate resources to fight back. Political pundits will look at our numbersto gauge the strength and depth of our fundraising operation.

The GOP picked up seats and made gains \u2013 andthey are not taking their feet off the gas. With redistricting guaranteeing anRepublican pick-up of at least two seats if not more, Jahana\u2019s frontline racehere in CT-05 is one that will make or break the Democrats\u2019 majority in 2022and beyond. So as we approach tonight's end-of-quarter fundraising deadline,we have to show up strong \u2013 the same way we did in 2018 . We have to declarethat we will not yield this seat and we have to do so now. Tell the deeppockets not to waste their money here this year.[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/JHCT-05-Email-Sept2021-FR-no?refcode=E11606-20210930-EOQ2-SL-DeadlineEOM-RegTemplate-NA-NA&amount;=25]DONATE TO KEEP CT-05 BLUE [https://secure.actblue.com/donate/JHCT-05-Email-Sept2021-FR-no?refcode=E11606-20210930-EOQ2-SB-DeadlineEOM-RegTemplate-NA-NA&amount;=25] It\u2019s been a busy and challenging few months \u2013 but through itall Jahana has been fighting for us. And because of our majorities, Democratswere able to get people back to work due to the American Rescue Plan, secureour right to vote, protect workers right to organize, reauthorize the ViolenceAgainst Women Act, codify the Equal Rights Amendment, end anti-LGBTQ+discrimination, support DACA recipients, and much more. Just last week, theHouse passed the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which would guarantee aperson's right to reproductive autonomy. None of this would be possiblewithout our majority. Will you make a grassroots contribution right now tohelp us protect the Democratic majority and keep CT-05 blue? All of ouradvancements hinge on this crucial toss-up district!

The Deep State is on a mission to takedown every single one of President Trump\u2019s closest allies -- and that puts meat the top of the list.

Weknew that the Deep State forces would try to destroy us. But we didn\u2019t care.The fight to save America was a fight worth waging. Unfortunately, now thatBiden and Kamala have seized control of the White House and have weaponizedthe FBI and DOJ, the swamp is REVOLTING by placing a bull\u2019s eye on the backsof every Trump loyalist who had the guts to challenge the Deep State.

It\u2019s another fundraising deadline for my campaign today \u2026 these deadlines are always a bit stressful and this quarter\u2019s report is likely the most important one of my career. This third-quarter fundraising report is going to show Republicans exactly where we stand after they spent over $200k in attack ads against us and a poll has us down 7 points. If we submit a fundraising report that shows weakness, they will attack us even more than they already have. Definitely not what we want. I keep checking ActBlue to see how many donations are coming through, and unfortunately we\u2019re not where we need to be. As you know, I refuse to take corporate PAC money. That certainly makes it harder to fundraise, but I think it\u2019s important to show I\u2019m fighting for the people, not corporations or special interests. That\u2019s why, with only 12 hours to go until the deadline, I\u2019m turning to you and personally asking, Peter: Will you make a donation of any amount to my campaign so we can hit our goal and fight back against the GOP\u2019s attempts to flip this seat?

This will be an open seat in the 2022 elections, so the path is wide open for a great conservative candidate to win.  And GREAT is the only word to describe Anna.  She is a warrior, literally. She grew up in some of the roughest neighborhoods in Los Angeles \u2013 and fought her way out by enlisting in the Air Force after high school. She learned conservative values the hard way \u2013 by watching what government dependency, illegal immigration, and lawlessness did to her community.  Anna embodies the American Dream, which is why she has been endorsed by President Donald Trump. | |  ---  **_\"Anna is a warrior, she is a winner, and it's time for all America FirstRepublicans to unite behind her strong campaign.\" \u2013 President Donald J.Trump_**| ---  **Please support Anna Paulina Luna today!**You may already know Anna from her work with Turning Point USA as a tirelessadvocate for conservative principles and policy.

Don't wantto receive our emails? Unsubscribe here. Peter, My name is John Castorani,and like a lot of other political candidates whose emails wind up in yourinboxI\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll give me 30-seconds to a minute to explain why I\u2019mreaching out to you today. I\u2019m a 29-year-old conservative from centralVirginia and I love this country of ours with all of my heart. Until earlierthis year I was a member of the United States intelligence community. Ideployed seven times with the Army\u2019s Special Operations Command huntingradical Islamic terrorists across the Islamic MAGREB and in continentalAfrica. The men my team and I were charged with hunting down and capturing, inevery case, posed an existential threat to democratic countries around theworld, andI\u2019m proud to say for that for 11 years my job was to track down andeliminate threats to your family and my own. Upon the election of Joe Bidento the presidency I gave up my career in the intelligence service \u2013 along withmy security clearance \u2013 to run for Congress . I did this because I\u2019m scaredto death that Biden is going to repeat the same mistakes of President Obama,and we\u2019re all going to pay the price. If your interest is still piqued, I\u2019mcounting on you to continue reading. As I said, I\u2019ve given up my career to runfor Congress with the intention of holding Washington bureaucrats moreaccountable, and in a moment, I\u2019m going to humbly ask for your financialassistance regarding my campaign. You may recall the attacks on the UnitedStates consulate in Benghazi, Libya, on the 11th of September 2012 (the 11thanniversary of the September 11th attacks). These attacks were carried out byan al-Qaeda affiliate called Ansar al-Sharia and resulted in the deaths of theAmerican ambassador to Libya, Christopher Stevens,who became the firstAmerican ambassador to die in the line of duty in more than three decades \u2013along with three additional American security/foreign service personnel. Thispolitical assassination made my blood boil. During my six years huntingterrorists in Africa, targeted political killings like the ones that tookplace in Benghazi reminded me \u2013 even in the worst of times \u2013 that our freedomisn't free at all.We have to fight for it. HELP ME FIGHT FOR YOU MAKE A GIFTTODAY \u203a\u203a Depending on who you ask, the Benghazi attack was either a randomattack or a pre-meditated campaign of murder. But the fact of the matter isthis: An American ambassador was killed in the line of duty and politicianspointed fingers at each other over who was responsible. That BS is thereasonI\u2019m running for Congress, and today I\u2019m asking if you\u2019ll chip-in $5 or$10 to help me get my campaign off the ground. At the time of the Benghaziattacks, Hillary Clinton knew that she would be running for President in 2016.Sheknew that these attacks weren\u2019t random as she suggested, and that as thesecretary of State she would be held accountable. So, like a good career out-of-touch politician, Mrs. Clinton engaged in a campaign of smoke andmirrors,purposefully leading the American public to believe this was a randomattack, when in fact she told her daughter, Chelsea, the very same eveningthat the attacks took place that they were pre-meditated by an al-Qaeda ally.Hillary Clinton\u2019s deceptions and lies will forever stand to serve as primeexamples of everything that is wrong in Washington. I\u2019m running to hold thesebureaucrats accountable and I hope you\u2019ll help put some wind in my sails bydonating $5, $10 or even $50 today . HELP ME FIGHT FOR YOU MAKE A GIFT TODAY\u203a\u203a In service John Castorani Republican Candidate for Congress VA-07 P.S. Ihave no money to invest in this campaign. What I do have is a lot of pride,which makes it hard to ask for financial assistance, so please, if you can,chip in $5 or $10 today to help send me to Congress and hold careerpoliticians accountable.

If you've looked at yourcalendar recently, you know the end of the 3rd quarter is TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT.For most folks, September 30th doesn't mean much.

I need your support to hit all of our goals while thereis still time left. Here are three reasons why our Q3 numbers are important:* My opponent already has $10 million in his war chest, and National Democratsjust announced they are spending millions of dollars to launch the earliestground game ever seen in Georgia. We need immediate resources to fight back. *Political pundits will look at our numbers to gauge the strength and depth ofour fundraising operation. * The amount raised in the 3rd quarter will send asignal to potential donors about our prospects of winning this race.

Over the years, they\u2019ve moved fromSenate race to Senate race, tearing down Democrat after Democrat by dumpingtens of millions from their war chest into nasty attack ads. We know this istheir playbook so luckily we know how to fight back. So here\u2019s the plan, we\u2019vegot three important jobs we need to do. Democrats must protect vulnerableincumbents like Raphael Warnock, flip open GOP-held seats in states like NorthCarolina, and defeat Republicans like Marco Rubio. Boy, it\u2019s a lot of work! Ifwe slip up and lose even one seat, we hand our Senate majority back toMcConnell and fail to deliver lasting progress on big issues like votingrights and infrastructure. Every donation you make goes straight towards ourwork to defend our Democratic Senate majority. So, will you pitch in $10 orany amount to fund our efforts to Defend the Senate?

I\u2019m in good health, and at home following CDC guidelines. But I have to behonest about something: this pandemic has affected everything from schools tobusinesses and yes, even our campaign.  We\u2019ve had to cancel all of our in-person fundraisers for the rest of themonth. It was the right thing to do, and I\u2019m proud of my team\u2019s decision.**But this means our FEC fundraising goal is taking a huge hit right beforeour numbers go public.**  To make matters worse, a new poll was just released that shows me neck-and-neck with my GOP opponents. In other words, we _really_ can\u2019t afford to post aweak FEC report.  My team is working overtime right now to rework our strategy and ensure wehave the resources necessary to lay the groundwork for victory. And messageslike this are more critical than ever to help us reach our FEC goal.  **The truth is, we won\u2019t reach our deadline tonight unless folks like you stepup and chip in to this email. So I\u2019m personally asking:**  **Will you split a donation of $25 or more right now between my campaign and Common Good VA? Your contribution right before our FEC deadline will ensure we have the resources we need to fight off the GOP\u2019s attacks, break the stalemate in the polls, and flip Ohio\u2019s Senate seat blue.** | **DONATE \u00bb** ---  Thank you for your support today.

I\u2019m going to ask you to chip in a splitcontribution to my friend and colleague Susie Lee\u2019s end-of-quarter fundraisingdeadline -- but first I want to explain why. I used to represent NV-03 in theHouse, so this district and its constituents are close to my heart. That\u2019s whyI\u2019m doing everything I can to make sure NV-03 continues to have a strongleader who\u2019s willing to fight for folks across the district -- and that personis Susie Lee. I can\u2019t overstate how close this race will be. Susie won herlast election by only 3 points, and this year NV-03 is set to be the mostcompetitive district in Battleground Nevada. The GOP has already spent morethan 1 million dollars to attack Susie this cycle, and we\u2019re expecting thatnumber to grow exponentially in the weeks ahead. That means Susie\u2019s Republicanopponents will be searching for any signs of weaknesses in her upcoming publicFEC fundraising report -- so, it\u2019s on us to make sure there aren\u2019t any. I\u2019mcounting on you to stand with me and keep Susie fighting for NV-03 inCongress.

With our biggest FEC deadline at midnight tonight, our financedirector is worried that we won't have the resources necessary to keep up insuch a competitive race.

On top of that, several members of Trump'snetwork, from Betsy DeVos to Mike Pompeo, have visited the Granite State in anattempt to rally their far-right base. Donald Trump himself even encouragedMitch McConnell's top pick to run against Maggie. The GOP is all in onflipping this seat. Mitch McConnell and his allies are already spendingmillions against Maggie \u2013 and Donald Trump and Senate Republicans have raisedhundreds of millions more to take back the Senate.

That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that we\u2019re inwhat\u2019s called a \u201cfrontline\u201d or highly competitive district, and that quarterlygoal is huge. It has to be. So, while 97% sounds great, we\u2019re still a fewthousand dollars short. This is where you come in. If you\u2019re reading thisemail you fall into one of three categories: 1. You haven\u2019t yet made up yourmind about the race. I\u2019ll be blunt: Kirsten is the most experienced candidate,has the most support from elected officials and organizations, and mostimportantly, has the most grassroots supporters (like you) backing her. Thisis a very competitive seat, and we must put forward the candidate that givesDemocrats the best chance to win and maintain our majority in Congress. Thatcandidate is without question Kirsten Engel.https://secure.actblue.com/donate/engel-for-arizona-1?refcode=X_093021_EOQ_N[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/engel-for-arizona-1?refcode=X_093021_EOQ_N]2.

But if you\u2019re reading this email, I\u2019m willing to betyour interest is more than just casual. You\u2019re invested. You want to see theseat stay Democratic and you know Kirsten is the best candidate to do that.And here\u2019s the thing: we\u2019ll have casual supporters contribute next year. Butagain, forgive my bluntness, we need the money now. We need to hire grassrootsorganizers, we need to print things like palm cards, petitions, and signs.

The typical kind of Senate campaign we\u2019ve seenin North Carolina hasn\u2019t worked for Democrats frankly. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve saidfrom day one that we have to try something different. What I\u2019ve learned frommy previous statewide campaigns is that we really need leaders who focus onthe people they serve. We must speak to the hopes and needs of every NorthCarolinian \u2014 particularly those who have been left behind and ignored byWashington for so long. And in a tough race like this, we will need to buildthe largest grassroots movement our state has ever seen to mobilize voterseverywhere. Reporting a strong number after tonight\u2019s deadline will send apowerful message that we have what it takes to do just that. So can you make a$3 donation to our campaign before our FEC deadline at midnight? I cannot winthis race for U.S. Senate alone. It will require all of us to come together aspart of this bottom-up, grassroots effort.[https://secure.actblue.com/donate/cb-em-sep21/?refcode2=a8405204-1322-ec11-981f-501ac510a405] Look, Republicans knowour campaign is one of Democrats\u2019 prime opportunities to flip a seat andexpand the Senate majority.

Myamendment BANS the federal government from using your tax dollars to enforceANY vaccine mandate on small businesses and workers. I promised Kansans andAmericans I would take action to protect their freedom and stop ridiculous,unconstitutional federal mandates. And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing. Todayalso marks our End of Quarter fundraising deadline. When it passes, ourfundraising numbers will be made public, and they'll be used as a barometer ofour momentum in this fight against Joe Biden's overreach.https://winred.kansansformarshall.com/marshall/2021-eoq3-email?utm_source=sgrc&utm;_medium=email&utm;_campaign=2021sep30hf1 So, if you\u2019re able,please chip in whatever you can afford RIGHT NOW.https://winred.kansansformarshall.com/marshall/2021-eoq3-email?utm_source=sgrc&utm;_medium=email&utm;_campaign=2021sep30hf1 To me, the contrast is asclear as it gets. Democrats want to strap a mask on your face, force a vaccinein your arm, and endlessly lockdown our economy. Republicans are fighting todefend individual liberty, our Founding Principles, and our way of life. Thefirst step to stopping this nonsense once and for all is to take back theSenate majority. And that takes momentum and resources, which is why emailslike this and deadlines like today's are so crucialhttps://winred.kansansformarshall.com/marshall/2021-eoq3-email?utm_source=sgrc&utm;_medium=email&utm;_campaign=2021sep30hf1 If you're with me, then Ineed you to stand with me RIGHT NOW, before today\u2019s vote and tonight\u2019sdeadline. Please chip in whatever you can. We\u2019ll share continued updates inthe hours ahead about my amendment.

As of now we\u2019re just $10,130 short of ourFIRST fundraising goal of the entire campaign\u2026 \u2026 And a group of generousWisconsin conservatives have offered to match all contributions at the finalhour before tonight\u2019s deadline. Now more than ever, I\u2019m counting on YOU totake advantage of this opportunity to ensure we hit our goal. Please make anurgent contribution before the end-of-quarter deadline TONIGHT at 11:59 P.M.to help me crush our FIRST fundraising goal of the campaign -- and yourcontribution will be MATCHED. Thank you, Rebecca Kleefisch Former LieutenantGovernor of Wisconsin Republican Candidate for Governor - - - - ForwardedMessage - - - - From: Rebecca Kleefisch Date: Tues, Sept 28, 2021 Subject:Where we stand To: dpwillis67@gmail.com Friend, I\u2019m truly honored by theoutpouring of support we\u2019ve received from grassroots conservatives like youever since we launched our campaign for governor. Which is why it pains me tohave to tell you that, as things stand, we\u2019re $29,645 behind on our goal withour FIRST fundraising deadline of the campaign nearly here. I\u2019m counting onyour sustained support at this pivotal moment to ensure we meet our firstdeadline to TAKE THE LEAD in this TOSS-UP race. Please make an urgentcontribution before the end-of-quarter deadline to help me crush our FIRSTfundraising goal of the entire campaign. CONTRIBUTE $25 CONTRIBUTE $50CONTRIBUTE $75 CONTRIBUTE $100 CONTRIBUTE $250 CONTRIBUTE OTHER AMOUNTWe\u2019ve seen time and again just how far national Democrats are willing to go tohold onto to such a crucial battleground state like Wisconsin. In fact, NancyPelosi and Chuck Schumer were just in Wisconsin this summer helping stateDemocrats fill Tony Evers\u2019 warchest. With our race already a 50-50 toss-up, wecan\u2019t waste a single moment in marshaling the resources to fight back--especially with our FIRST deadline just hours away. CONTRIBUTE BEFORE THEDEADLINE We all know the failure that has marked Tony Evers\u2019 term asgovernor\u2026 Jobs lost, schools closed, our police disrespected, our cities leftburning, and our elections left vulnerable. But like every other radicalliberal governor across the country, Tony Evers only cares about one person--himself. The stakes are simply too high, Friend. We can\u2019t fall short at thiscritical deadline. We can\u2019t allow Evers to think he has the momentum right outof the gate. So please, make an urgent contribution before the end-of-quarterdeadline to help me crush our FIRST fundraising goal of the entire campaign sothat we can TAKE THE LEAD in this toss-up race and FIRE Tony Evers.

And your donation could never be more important than it is right now. DONATE. HELP ME MEET MY END OF QUARTER GOAL. Socialists are on the verge of passing their massive FOUR TRILLION DOLLAR TAX AND SPENDING plan. This bill is straight from the socialist dreams of Bernie Sanders\u2026 because he WROTE THE BILL. Every socialist policy you can think of is in this bill. Medicare for All\u2026 the Green New Deal\u2026 amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants. All of it is in Bernie\u2019s bill and all of it is paid for by RAISING YOUR TAXES. But they haven\u2019t passed it yet. JOIN THE FIGHT. STOP BERNIE'S BILL. If we make enough noise, if we educate enough Americans about the devastating impact of this socialist scheme, the public pressure will be too much for Nancy and Joe to handle. I plan on leading that public messaging push. And I plan on turning up the heat on Democrats so high that they either kill Bernie\u2019s bill or face the electoral consequences of passing it. But I can\u2019t do this without your help. I can\u2019t expose the truth about these policies with patriots like you on the sideline. I need you in the game, fighting by my side for a better American future. Together, the socialists don\u2019t stand a chance. Are you with me? In Service, Dan Crenshaw DONATE. HOLD THE LINE AGAINST THE SWAMP SOCIALISTS. If you prefer to donate by mailing a check, your donation will still count towards this End Of Quarter deadline if it is postmarked before October 1.

And now they\u2019re refusing to pay for it. Worse? They\u2019re usingthat talk of debt to try to tank Democrats\u2019 efforts to put forward programs onhealth care, child care, climate action, and much more. It\u2019s really thatsimple. That\u2019s Republican brinkmanship. Threatening a dangerous outcome ifthey don\u2019t get what they want. And it could prove disastrous if they followthrough with a government shutdown. They\u2019re threatening to default on theUnited States\u2019 federal debt right as we negotiate to pass a once-in-a-generation investment in American infrastructure and families. That would meanmillions of jobs lost. Families pushed into poverty. Not to mention settingoff a global financial crisis. For Americans working to make ends meet \u2014 itwould be a catastrophe. But to Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, and HouseRepublicans it would be a \u201cwin\u201d \u2014 at least in their craven brand of politics.The party of Trump will try to halt Democrats from accomplishing an inch ofprogress by any means necessary \u2014 even when the consequences fall on theshoulders of the American people. So with the final deadline of the FECquarter less than 12 hours away \u2014 can you pitch in right now to ensure I havethe resources to fight back and protect our Democratic majorities? TheRepublican Party is too dangerous to come near holding the levers of power inCongress ever again.

Last week, the select committee announced they were issuing subpoenas tosome of Donald Trump's top aides -- including chief of staff Mark Meadows andWhite House adviser Steve Bannon. This is a huge moment, but Trump has alreadymade it clear he's going to fight these subpoenas in order to obstruct theinvestigation and hide the truth. We can't let him get away with it.

I'd like to tell you alittle about my husband Chris, why I'm so excited for him to be the nextCongressman from PA-17, and why he needs your help before tomorrow's majorfundraising deadline. Chris and I met in law school nearly a decade ago, and Icould never have imagined where we or our country would be today. We've builta family of three amazing young children (plus our adorable pup, YankeeDoodle). Whether it's being a father or using the law to protect people'scivil rights, Chris at every turn demonstrates compassion, honesty, anddetermination. And he never loses sight of what matters the most, for ourfamily and for other families here in western Pennsylvania. These are thevalues we need more of in Congress, now more so than ever. No political raceis easy \u2014 especially for a young family \u2014 but I believe strongly in what Chrishas to offer western Pennsylvania. He'll be a fearless advocate for policiesthat will protect our democracy and transform our economy for the better, andhe won't let special interest groups tell him what to do. So I'm doing all Ican to help this campaign come out of the gate strong. Tomorrow is the firstpublic fundraising deadline since Chris announced his candidacy, and he needsas much support as possible. I know that Chris will be an incrediblerepresentative for the people of PA-17.

I knew I had to get in the race.**  **I\u2019m asking you to split a donation between my campaign and Common Good VA sowe can stop the alt-right and Marjorie Taylor Greene:** ** Donate $25 Donate $50 Donate $100 Donate other ** Now, let\u2019s not kid ourselves: the battle to beat Greene andother Trump-Republicans like Glenn Youngkin will be difficult. Greene is thenew darling of the Radical Right media machine -- and she\u2019s backed by millionsin special-interest money. But one thing I\u2019ve learned throughout my career inservice is that when the mission is this important, you have to stay focused.  **If you believe that Greene and Youngkin are unfit to serve -- chip in now tohelp me and Common Good VA take down the radical right. A donation of $25,$50, or $100 will go such a long way in ensuring that we can defeat hatred inour communities.**  Together we can accomplish great things,  Marcus Flowers **![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8euRBs-h-YjxDCHftBhr1QGXnOnkv9kerK1NzJSxh-WPFNtiutPfJZoL9zBPW585xV4msLuQBGZ2Qxg8hNnI3f1CsBUXwQmEeA3c4vXbgJcY9tsl35hdAhy40wNqIgQhOQ94tnTQ)**  | **DONATE \u00bb** ---   Paid for by Common Good Virginia ---     | | Sent via ActionNetwork.org.

I\u2019m ingood health, and at home following CDC guidelines. But I have to be honestabout something: this pandemic has affected everything from schools tobusinesses and yes, even our campaign. We\u2019ve had to cancel all of our in-person fundraisers for the rest of the month. It was the right thing to do,and I\u2019m proud of my team\u2019s decision. But this means our FEC fundraising goalis taking a huge hit right before our numbers go public. To make mattersworse, a new poll was just released that shows me neck-and-neck with my GOPopponents. In other words, we really can\u2019t afford to post a weak FEC report.My team is working overtime right now to rework our strategy and ensure wehave the resources necessary to lay the groundwork for victory. And messageslike this are more critical than ever to help us reach our FEC goal. The truthis, we won\u2019t reach our deadline in one day unless folks like you step up andchip in to this email. So I\u2019m personally asking: Will you donate $5 or more tomy campaign and Jacky Rosen\u2019s right now? Your contribution before our FECdeadline will ensure we have the resources we need to fight off the GOP\u2019sattacks, break the stalemate in the polls, and flip Ohio\u2019s Senate seat blue.https://secure.actblue.com/donate/jr-210929-ryan?refcode=jr_em_nd_210929_2Thank you for your support today.

I thought we'd be in very capable hands with either of them asour Democratic nominee. Ultimately, I decided to support Randy, but now thathe's withdrawn from the race, I'm proud to support Kirsten. I\u2019ve seenfirsthand how much Kirsten cares about issues important to Southern Arizonans,like fighting climate change and building an economy that works for everyone.And I also know that she\u2019s a fighter to her core. That\u2019s probably why she\u2019snever lost a race. We need that experience\u2026 that fight, to ensure this seatremains blue. So, I'm asking all my fellow Friese backers to join me inputting all our support behind Kirsten. Send this email to a friend, followKirsten on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, and most importantly, make acontribution today before this critical deadline. We need Kirsten Engel inCongress.

This mandate is adding salt on the woundto businesses in Indiana and across the nation that are JUST getting back ontheir feet.
