To some, they show if we have the resources to reach more voters.To others, they're a measurement of just how high the energy there is for acampaign among grassroots donors giving just a few dollars at a time.Generally, they are a window into our ability to put together a winningcampaign and mobilize folks with our message. So we have to hunker down and doall we can to give Lynn a strong show of support at the outset of the ElectionYear. We've been demonstrating on the trail that Lynn is the candidate withthe strongest record of achievement and that she has a clear record of winningbig races \u2014 now we have to back that up with robust fundraising.
